### **⚙️ Project Structure and Scripts**
The repository includes the following key scripts:

- `data_prepare.py`: Resizes images while preserving aspect ratio and creates 10-fold cross-validation splits.
- `test.py`: Runs inference using a trained detection model (TensorFlow or Detectron2 RetinaNet) on a single image.
- `train.py`: Loads and trains various models including:
  - TensorFlow-based: `EfficientDet`, `Faster R-CNN`, `SSD`
  - Detectron2-based: `RetinaNet`
  - Ultralytics-based:  `Yolo11`
- `crop_image.py`: Applies **center cropping** to all images in a given folder and saves the cropped outputs.

Each script includes command-line arguments for flexibility and integration.
